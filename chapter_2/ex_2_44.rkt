;Exercise 2.44:
;Define the procedure up-split used by cornersplit.
;It is similar to right-split, except that it switches
;the roles of below and beside.

(define a (beside einstein

(define b (below a a))

  (let ((painter2 (beside painter (flip-vert painter))))
    (below painter2 painter2)))

  (if (= n 0)
